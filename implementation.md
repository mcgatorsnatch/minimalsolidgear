# SolidLight Framework Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the structure and functionality of the SolidLight Framework, a lightweight version of the original Solid Framework.

## Framework Overview

The SolidLight Framework is a minimal implementation that enables static language models to adapt without weight updates. It preserves the core functionality of the original framework: memory persistence, alignment checks, and dual-time scale adaptation.

## Key Components

### 1. Memory System (`memory.py`)
- Implemented `QuantumMemory` class using Redis for persistent vector storage
- Features include:
  - Semantic search with vector similarity
  - Episodic buffer for recent interactions
  - Automatic tagging and linking (Zettelkasten-inspired)
  - PGP encryption for security
  - Memory decay and static schema reinforcement

### 2. Orchestrator (`orchestrator.py`)
- Implemented `QuantumSynapseOrchestrator` to manage the main interaction flow
- Features include:
  - Five-step chat loop: Data Ingestion → Feature Selection → Prediction → Alignment Check → Memory Update
  - Dual-time scale adaptation (fast and slow cycles)
  - Alignment checking against encrypted JSON rules
  - Placeholder for Mistral 7B 4-bit quantized inference
  - Drift detection with context window adjustment

### 3. CLI Interface (`cli_interface.py`)
- Implemented `ExecutionInterface` for command processing
- Commands supported:
  - `chat` - Interactive conversation
  - `search` - Semantic search in stored memories
  - `save` - State persistence
  - `help` - Command documentation

### 4. Main Entry Point (`main.py`)
- Simplified CLI-based interaction loop
- GPU detection and optimization
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown

## Implementation Choices

1. **Static vs. Dynamic**: Removed all weight update mechanisms, trainable gates, and reinforcement learning components
2. **Minimal Memory**: Simplified episodic buffer and memory consolidation
3. **Streamlined CLI**: Removed complex command handling, Typer parsing, history management
4. **Simplified Alignment**: Basic rule-based alignment with PGP encryption
5. **Hardware Focus**: Optimized for high-end hardware (RTX 3090/4090)

## Differences from Original Framework

| Feature | Original Framework | SolidLight Framework |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Model Adaptation** | RL, meta-learning, trainable gates | Static memory only |
| **Memory System** | Complex with metrics, graph analytics | Simplified Redis vectors |
| **Planning** | HyperPlanner, execution modules | Removed entirely |
| **CLI** | Feature-rich with Typer | Minimal string parsing |
| **Learning** | Dynamic Hebbian learning | Static co-occurrence |

## Example Usage

The framework includes an `example.py` script demonstrating:
1. Memory operations (add, search, schema reinforcement)
2. Chat interactions with memory integration
3. Fast and slow adaptation cycles
4. Alignment checks

## Future Enhancements

1. Complete the actual Mistral 7B integration
2. Add persistence for co-occurrence data
3. Enhance the tagging system with NLP techniques
4. Improve memory schema reinforcement with spaced repetition
5. Add cross-session memory persistence strategies

## Requirements

- Redis with vector search support
- GPU with 24+ GB VRAM (RTX 3090/4090)
- Dependencies: redis, sentence-transformers, torch, pgpy, etc.
